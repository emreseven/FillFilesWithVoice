# To avoid installer failures during deployment, it is intentionally disabled here.
# If you run locally and want mic recording, install it manually:
#   pip install streamlit-mic-recorder
# streamlit-mic-recorder>=0.1.0

# Local session management - no external dependencies needed

# Additional useful dependencies for production deployment
